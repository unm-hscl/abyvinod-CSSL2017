% MVNLPS Multivariate Normal Distribution Value for an ellipsoid.        
%        MVNVAL = MVNLPS( MU, SIGMA, Q, E, R, RE ) computes
%        an MVN value to relative accuracy RE for an ellipsoid centered 
%        at Q with radius R and positive semi-definite ellipsoid matrix E: 
%                MVNVAL = PROB( ( X - Q )'E ( X - Q ) < R^2 )
%        SIGMA is a positive definite covariance matrix for a multivariate
%        normal (MVN) density with mean MU. MU and Q must be column vectors.
%        Example:
%         sg = [ 3 2 1;2 2 1;1 1 1]; mu = [1 -1 0]';        
%         e = [4 1 -1; 1 2 1; -1 1 2]; q = [2 3 -2]';
%         p = mvnlps( mu, sg, q, e, 4, 1e-5 ); disp(p)
